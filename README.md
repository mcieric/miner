# About

SixGPT is a decentralized synthetic data generation platform built on the Vana network. We empower users by giving them ownership of their data and enabling them to earn from it.

The SixGPT Miner is a software package which allows users to contribute data they generate for wikipedia question-answer based tasks to the network for rewards.
In the future, we will support other tasks such as chatbot conversations, image captioning, etc.
